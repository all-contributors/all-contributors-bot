## Issues to work on:
[See the issues](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot/issues) here

Ideas not as issues yet:
- If the bot has an open pull request, don't open another one?
- How do we handle failure modes?
- Should we switch to typescript?



### Testing serverless locally
`yarn add serverless-dotenv-plugin`

in `serverless.yml` plugins add:
`- serverless-dotenv-plugin`


Create file test-file.json with payload
```
curl -vX POST http://localhost:3000/ -d @test-payload.json \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Event: issue_comment"
```
